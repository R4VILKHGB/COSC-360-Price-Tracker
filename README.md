# Price-Tracker
Our website will allow registered users to track item prices over time from online retailers at different stores. Unregistered users will be able to search and view general price trends in real time. The goal of our project is to produce a service that will allow users to track item prices in real time, set alerts, notifications and leave reviews. Functionality exists for searching/categorizing items. Additionally, unregistered users can view item prices but not see the details of items.
